### Swagger
The Swagger specification defines a set of files required to describe such an API. These files can then be used by the Swagger-UI project to display the API and Swagger-Codegen to generate clients in various languages. Additional utilities can also take advantage of the resulting files, such as testing tools.<br/>Swagger is available for this API server. To open swagger UI, open http://localhost:8080/swagger/index.html.
